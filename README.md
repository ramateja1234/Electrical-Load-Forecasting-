Load Forecasting Project

Description

This project focuses on building a robust model for electrical load forecasting, leveraging deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, as well as Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) for signal preprocessing. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of short-term load forecasting, which is essential for efficient energy management and grid stability.

Key Features

Utilizes deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras) for model development.

Implements CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence prediction.

Integrates VMD for decomposing time series data into intrinsic mode functions to improve feature quality.

Supports data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

Performance metrics for evaluating the model's accuracy.
